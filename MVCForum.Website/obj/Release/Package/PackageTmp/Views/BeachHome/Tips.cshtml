                                In Australian waterways in the 12 months to 30 June 2015, 271 lives
                                 were lost to drowning. Here are some water safety tips for user
                                 at swimming pool, inland waterways and the beach.

                                Be aware of all beach closures and advisories when visiting the beach,
                                because closures or advisories caused by poor water quality can prevent
                                the visitors from enjoying the beach. Water contaminated by sewage,
                                storm-water pollution, and other hazardous substances can make beachgoers
                                very sick. The EPA’s “Beach Report 2015–16 Summer Highlights Report” is
                                based on Melbourne Water’s weekly water-quality monitoring data from
                                November 1, 2015, until April 10, 2016, which can be used by the public
                                to choose the beach from water quality perspective.

                                is Rip Currents. They are powerful, channeled currents of water flowing
                                away from shore which can quickly pull swimmers out to sea. According
                                to National Drowning Report Australia 2015, 271 people drowned in Australian
                                waterways and 17% of cases of beach drowning deaths in the age group among
                                25 to 50 year-old males were known to involve rip current, 6% occurred outside patrol hours.

                                jellyfish sting in Australia can cause death, with there are several venomous species
                                of jellyfish such as the box jellyfish and Irukandji Jellyfish. The box jellyfish has
                                up to 60 tentacles, all with millions of tiny harpoons from which the venom is injected.
                                Their sting is excruciating and can cause rapid death from shock within two to five minutes,
                                or if the venom plays out, death can occur in 20-30 minutes.

                                occur in Australian beaches. Shark attacks, though rare, are most likely to

                                responsible for the attack for multiple attacks, but most of Great White

                                It is safe to say that skin damage from UV radiation is the most common hazard at
                                Australian beaches. Sunburn is a radiation burn to the skin. The signs of sunburn
                                can start to appear in less than 15 minutes and skin can turn red within two to
                                six hours of being burnt. It will continue to develop for the next 24 to 72 hours
                                and, depending on the severity, can take days or weeks to heal. According to Cancer
                                Council’s National Sun Protection Survey, in Australia, sunburn can occur within
                                as little as 15 minutes and cause permanent and irreversible skin damage.
